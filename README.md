# BurpExtension
BurpSuite Extension. This is a small plugin which is not developed completely, is focused to achieve the objective of the pentest. The extension is based on Jython and is developed partially as an idea to integrate the burp with testing objectives. Both true positive and true negetive results can be seperated in burpsuite and can be very useful for audit purposes
